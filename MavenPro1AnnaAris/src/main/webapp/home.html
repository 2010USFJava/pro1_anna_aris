			<h2>Employee Reimbersement Program</h2>
			<p>The purpose of TRMS is to provide a system that encourages quality knowledge growth relevant to an individualâ€™s expertise. </p>

				<p> Currently, TRMS provides reimbursements for university courses, seminars, certification preparation classes, certifications, and technical training.  The current system relies solely on email communication, requiring manual lookups of available funds and is error-prone due to inbox clutter and incorrect routing of tasks.  Furthermore, there is no way to record and report on reimbursements awarded, and so the company has no way to identify highly-invested courses that could be developed to be offered in-house.</p>
